# Sprint Review and Retrospective

This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my final project in CS 250. The following sections reflect on the work done and provide insights into my approach to software development.

## Reflections on Key Questions

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is crucial for developing software that meets the end user's expectations. User stories play a significant role in this process by breaking down the requirements into actionable tasks. This method ensures that each functionality developed adds value to the user, allowing for a more focused and user-centered approach to programming.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development by breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, driven by user stories. I emphasize an Agile mindset, which includes being adaptable, collaborative, and committed to continuous improvement. In future projects, I plan to incorporate Agile processes like Scrum, with a focus on sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, to ensure a flexible and iterative development process.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves active participation in team goals, open communication, and effective collaboration. It requires reliability, a willingness to assist others, and openness to feedback. In Agile teams, it's essential to engage fully in ceremonies like stand-ups and retrospectives, fostering a team environment built on mutual respect and shared responsibility for the project's success.
